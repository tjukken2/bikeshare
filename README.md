### A code project for bike share data

### Description
The base idea is to create an interactive user experience included with gaining insights into the bike shared data for three US cities - Chicago, New York City and Washington DC. The data is provided by <a href="https://www.motivateco.com">Motivate</a> a bike share provider. The bike share data has been collected when the users of the system borrow a bike. You will find interesting information which station the user has picked up the bike and where it gets delivered, time of these two events and some simple user information (not for Washington). The coding project is part of Udacity course: <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/programming-for-data-science-nanodegree--nd104">Programming for data science</a>.
